## About Me
Currently I am a junior studying data analytics and computer science at Drake University, with an expected graduation of May 2024. Additionally, I am minoring in actuarial science, and am actively envolved in the Phi Chi Theta - Business Fraternity on campus. 

As for my experience in analytical and coding languages, I have the most experience in Python, Java, R & SAS, and MySQL. Following that, I additionally have experience in C, the MIPS assembly language, Salesforce, Haskell, and have most recently begun working on furthering my understanding in R and Python in my coursework. Outside of my coursework, I have begun looking into the syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a project I plan to work on for my current workplace at Drake ITS on campus. 

## Plans after Graduation
My current plans after graduating from Drake University are still being considered, but I am hopeful to find employment within the Greater Des Moines Metropolitan Area in hopes of continuing my growth in the fields of data analytics and computer science in the beginning of my professional career.
